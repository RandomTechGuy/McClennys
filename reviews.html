        <blockquote id="rgbq"><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had my insurance with Jason for over 9 years now.  I couldn't imagine having it anywhere else.  He always gets back to me right away to address any concern I may have .  He is also more thorough in going over the different parts of the policies to make sure I have the coverage I am looking for than I was used to in the past.  There was recently an accident in our family and Jason and his team where right there every step of the way.  I was so thankful I had the coverage I did and an agent like Jason available to help me.  I highly recommend Jason and his team!<br>

        <blockquote id="rgbq"><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is such a negative stigma around insurance agents, but Jason McClenny and his agency really raise the bar to the clouds. They take the time to explain coverages in a way that is easy to understand for everyone. I have had Jason work with a ton of my clients and even a few of my family members and I always get the same feedback -" JASON IS AMAZING!!!" - So if you are looking for an agent who actually cares about you and your family - stop here and call McClenny Insurance.Sometimes its not about price, its about service!!!<br>
