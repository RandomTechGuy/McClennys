    <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McClenny Insurance Agency, Inc was founded by <em>E.G McClenny</em> in 1943.  <em>E.G.</em> knew the secret to building successful businesses.  He also started building houses and served as the first agency manager with Nationwide in Richmond, Virginia.  <em>E.G.</em> formed, at that time, a captive relationship with Nationwide.  This agreement prevented <em>E.G.</em> from writing business outside of Nationwide.  He passed his knowledge and the agency on to his son <em>Robert McClenny</em> who ran the successful agency for 30 plus years.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspIn 2002, “Bob” brought his son <em>Jason McClenny</em> in to help run the agency.  In April of 2018 the agency was at a crossroads as Bob’s time working was coming to an end and Jason’s time to take over the agency was on the cusp.  However, the market had changed and being a captive agent for one company was not as rewarding as it once was.  The agency felt the need to offer clients a choice in price and coverage options that can only be attained by an independent agency.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspOn May 1st of 2018 the McClenny Insurance Agency was successfully acquired by <em>Jason McClenny</em> as the principle agent and it received its independence from Nationwide.  Now Nationwide and its suite quality products is just one of the many companies the McClenny agency represents. This new found independence allows the McClenny Insurance Agency the opportunity to offer their clients a greater variety of products and services to meet their individual needs.</p></blockquote>
